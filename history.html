<p class="text">Cheese is a food made from the milk of various animals by fermenting it with rennet or various lactic acid bacteria and separating the whey. The food product is made in the form of a semi-solid or solid mass, which is obtained by fermenting milk and further processing the curd. There are many types of cheese and they are classified by, for example, the type of milk, fat content, consistency, production process and ripening time. As a rule, the milk of domestic animals is used: cows, goats, sheep, buffaloes. It usually has a light yellow or white color. </p>

<p class="text">Cheese is one of the most popular food products in the world. Hundreds of varieties of cheese are made in the world. Their type, consistency and aroma depend on the origin of the milk (including animal nutrition), whether it has been pasteurized, fat content, bacteria and mould, processing, conditions and duration of maturation. Herbs, spices or wood smoke can be used as flavoring agents. The yellow and red color of many cheeses is the result of the addition of annatto. Mold in cheeses with mold can be white, bluish-green, or dark red in color.</p>
